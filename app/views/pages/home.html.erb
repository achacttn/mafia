    <p>When game starts, you will immediately be assigned a role of Mafia or Citizen.
    If you are a citizen, you do not know which of the other players are your team members or the enemy.
    It is your role to determine who is secretly a mafia, and lynch every last one.
    Take care not to kill innocents, lest mafia take over the town.

    If you are a mafia, you are aware of who your teammates are. It is your role to become a majority in this town.
    To do so without arousing suspicion, you will have to convincingly blend in as a citizen, and conspire with your mafia team.


    The Mafia party game presents a conflict between the Mafia – the informed minority – and the Innocents – the uninformed majority. Originated by Dmitry Davidoff of the USSR in 1986, this popular game has many constiations and can be played by a group of seven or more people. For very large groups, we suggest adding additional characters.

    <br>The game has two phases; night, when the Mafia might secretly “murder” an innocent, and “day” when Innocents vote to eliminate a Mafiosi suspect. The game ends when all the Mafia members are eliminated or there are more Mafia members than Innocents.</p>
